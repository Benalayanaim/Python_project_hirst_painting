## Python Turtle Hirst Painting
This Python project uses the Turtle module to recreate a simplified version of Damien Hirst's iconic spot paintings. 
Damien Hirst is a renowned contemporary artist known for his colorful and visually striking artworks, including his spot paintings series.

## Description
The project generates random colorful dots arranged in a grid pattern, similar to Hirst's spot paintings. 
It utilizes Python's Turtle graphics library to create the visual output. 
The user can specify parameters such as the size of the canvas, the number of rows and columns, and the colors of the dots.

## Features
